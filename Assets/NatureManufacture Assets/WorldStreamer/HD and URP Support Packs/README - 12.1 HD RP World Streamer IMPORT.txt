BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity  2021.2 or higher 
- you need HD SRP pipeline 12.1 if you use higher etc custom shaders could not work but seems they should. 
That's why we provide 12.1 version which seems to work with much higher versions aswell. 
For all higher RP versions please use 12.1 HD RP support pack.

Be patient this tech is so fluid... we coudn't fallow ever beta version

Step 1 
	- !!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Find diffusion profile list section at HDRP Default Settings and drag and drop our SSS settings diffusion profiles for foliage and water into Diffusion profile list:
		  NM_SSSSettings_Skin_NM Foliage Trees
		  NM_SSSSettings_Skin_NM Foliage
		  NM_SSSSettings_Water_Forest
		  
	Without this foliage, water materials will not become affected by scattering and they will look wrong.
	Open "HDRPMediumQuality" in project settings or "HDRPHighQuality" depends what unity use i your projectas default and:
	- Check if contact shadows are turned on
	- LOD Bias to = 1 or 1.5


Step 2 Go to project settings and quality and set:
	- Set VSync to don't sync

Step 3 Find "Game Streamer Scene" and open it.

Step 4 - Add scenes from streamer into build settings

Step 5 - HIT PLAY!:)
